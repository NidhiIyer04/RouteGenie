# RouteGenie

RouteGenie is a Flutter-based mobile application for route optimization and delivery planning. It allows users to input delivery points, select a vehicle type, and get the most efficient delivery route based on selected criteria (time, distance, or fuel). The app communicates with a FastAPI backend to compute optimized routes.

## Features

- Select vehicle type and fuel efficiency
- Choose start location and delivery points
- Optimize routes based on time, distance, or fuel
- Visualize optimized routes on Google Maps
- See total distance, time, fuel cost, and optimization score

## Prerequisites

Before running the app, ensure the following tools are installed:

- Flutter (latest stable version recommended)
- Android Studio or VS Code with Flutter and Dart plugins
- Android SDK with emulator or physical device setup
- FastAPI backend running locally or on server
- Dart SDK
- NDK 27.0.12077973

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/RouteGenie.git
   cd RouteGenie/frontend
````

2. Install Flutter dependencies:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Start the FastAPI backend server:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
   ```

4. Run the app on an emulator or device:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Troubleshooting

* If Gradle fails due to NDK version mismatch, ensure build.gradle.kts specifies ndkVersion = "27.0.12077973"
* If packages are missing, run flutter pub get
* If backend is not reachable, ensure correct IP and port are used in baseUrl
